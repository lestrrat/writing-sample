# How to Make a Sourdough

This document will describe the steps involved in baking a sourdough bread.
After reading this document, you should have a basic understanding of the
process of baking a sourdough bread.

A sourdough bread is a type of bread that uses natural yeast and lactic acid
bacteria to leaven the bread dough. Because it does not use baker's yeast
(active dry yeast, instant yeast, etc), some special care must be taken to 
make sure the dough ferments and produces enough gas for the bread to rise.

Since this document will describe the recipe for a rustic, campagne style
sourdough bread, some special care must be taken when baking the dough,
which this document will also cover.
