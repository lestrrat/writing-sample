# How to Make a Sourdough

This document will describe the steps involved in baking a sourdough bread.
After reading this document, you should have a basic understanding of the
process of baking a sourdough bread.

A sourdough bread is a type of bread that uses natural yeast and lactic acid
bacteria to leaven the bread dough. Because it does not use baker's yeast
(active dry yeast, instant yeast, etc), some special care must be taken to 
make sure the dough ferments and produces enough gas for the bread to rise.

Since this document will describe the recipe for a rustic, campagne style
sourdough bread, some special care must be taken when baking the dough,
which this document will also cover.

# Preparing the Initial Starter

Before even attempting to bake anything, you will have to prepare the initial starter.

The starter is a mixture of flour and water with yeast and other bacteria added
either by using natural microorganisms that are already present within the flour, or 
by separately cultivating a culture of microorganisms from ingredients such as fruits.

The most simple way is to take unbleached flour and the same amount of water, mix
them and let them sit at room temperature (20~24 degrees celcius) for 2 to 3 days.

Start out by taking 50g of unbleached flour, and 50g of water. Mix them well so that
there are no dry spots, and leave it in a container, lightly sealed (it is more desirable
to have some amount of oxygen available to the mixture).

After 12 hours, add 25g of unbleached flour and 25g of water, and mix it well.
Repeat this step every 12 hours for 2 to 3 days, until the mixture starts to form
many small bubbles on the surface.  If you have too much mixture in your container,
you can safely discard some amount of the mixture before adding new flour and water.
For example, when it's time to add new flour and water, you could first remove 50g of
the mixture, then add the new ingredients. The total amount of the mixture left is not
too important as it is always easy to create more later.

Once you have a mixture with enough bubbles -- that is, a starter with enough
microorganisms that eat the flour and produce gas, your starter is ready. If you
see mold or any other suspicious looking elements, you might want to start over and
recreate your starter.

From then on you can take a portion of that starter to create more starters for
each new dough that you create. 

If you intend to keep on baking repeatedly, you can keep this initial starter in a
container, and store it in your refrigerator indefinitely, as long as you keep feeding it
regularly. Feeding consists of adding the same amount of flour and water at least once
a week. As before, you can always discard extra starter mixture if you have too much of it.

# Instructions to Bake One Camapgne-style Sourdough Bread

Once you have your initial starter, you can start the baking process. This recipe will
walk you through the steps required to bake a campagne style sourdough bread, and will
take anywhere from 12 hours to 3 days to complete, depending on the weather and your
equipment.

## Ingredients

Here are the ingredients required to prepare the starter for this one sourdough:
* 20g starter (from your intiial starter batch)
* 40g flour (bleached)
* 40g water

And here are the ingredients required for the rest of the dough
* 500g flour (bleached)
* 370g water
* 10g salt
* 10g olive oil (optional)
* small amount of rice flour

While the whole recipe could be prepare using just a your bare hands,
a bowl, and an oven, we assume that you already have the following equipment:
* a dutch oven
* cooking sheet / perchment
* scale
* dough scraper
* large bowl
* 2 pieces of cloth
* banneton (proofing basket)
* razor

Also, it is highly recommended that you purchase a stand mixer, unless you 
want to learn how to knead by yourself.

## Preparing the Stater

Before doing anything, we need to create a fresh batch of starter mixture
with very active microorganisms.

Some time before starting with the dough (the time varies depending on the weather),
take 20g of initial starter that you have made previously, and mix it well with
40g of flour and 40g of water. As soon as the mixture is created, the microorganisms
in the original starter will start to feed on the new flour, and will start multiplying.

The amount of time required for the starter to be ready greatly varies depending on the
weather. During hot summers, it will probably only take an hour or two. On cold winter
days, you will need to keep it in a temprate location, and may have to wait over night.

The starter will be ready when it has produced enough gas. To check, take one scoop
of the starter, and drop it in a cup filled with water. If the starter floats, it
is ready.

## Performing "Autolyse"

Once the starter is ready, you can start working with the dought. However, our recipe
calls for a dough with a high hydration level, which in turn means that the dough
will be soggy and hard to handle.

To alleviate some of this, we can perform an extra step called "autolyse". While the name
is fancy, this just means that you mix the flour and the water, and let it sit for
about an hour.

When the flour is mixed with the water, it naturally starts to form gluten. Therefore
simply leaving the dough sit for an hour allows us skip some portion of the kneading
required.

This step maybe omitted, especially if you are using a stand mixer and not your
bare hands to knead the dough. However, since it does save some work time, it is
highly recommended either way.

## Mixing, and Kneading the Dough

After performing autolyse, mix the dough and the starter in a bowl. Using either your hand or
a stand mixer, mix the ingredients well so that they incorporate. It is recommended that
you do not _knead_ the dough initially. Instead, fold the dough onto itself, and
merge the starter into the dough gradually.

Once the starter has been incorporated, start out by taking a pinch of the dough from one of
the sides, and pull it up, then fold it onto the dough. Rotate the dough 90 degrees, and
repeat the process 3 more times. This process is sometimes refered to as "stretch-and-fold".

While you are handling the dough, it is important to not pull so hard that the dough
breaks. The goal is to create a mesh of gluten over each other, not to cut the mesh.

After this point, some recipes call to start the next step, bulk fermentation, and
repeat the strech and fold process instead of kneading. This is a point of great debate,
but this recipe recommends that you knead the dough as much as you can, until, preferrably,
you have a smooth tone in the surface of the dough. This process is simplified if you can
use a stand mixer: simply mix the dough using a dough hook until the dough is smooth.

Once the kneading is done, add the salt. When you add the salt, it is sometimes easier
to add a drizzle of water so it's easier for the salt to be mixed. Also it is crucial
that you do not forget to add the salt, as otherwise you will end up with a bread with
an extremely dissappoing taste.

Knead the dough further until the salt is fully incorporated.

## Bulk Fermentation

With the dough kneaded, place the dough back in a bowl or a container. Optionally, coat
the sides of your container with olive oil before placing the dough in it, both to prevent
the dough from sticking, and to add some extra flavor.

Lightly seal the container using a wet piece of cloth. You may use plastic wraps as well,
but applying some extra moisture helps during the next step, which is called the
bulk fermentation.

In the bulk fermentation step, the goal is to have the microorganisms multiply within the
entire dough, and let them produce gas. This gas in turn creates small rooms within the dough,
thanks to the gluten network that you have created during the kneading process. Without the
glutain network, the gases escape far more easily, and you end up with a more dense dough
(or a very flat dough).

Just like when you were cultivating the microorganisms for your starter, it is important to
watch out for the temprature during the bulk fermentation stage. The yeast and other bacteria
are most active when the temperature is around 20 to 24 degrees celcius. During the summer,
make sure to keep the dough in an air-conditioned room. During the winter, try to find a
relatively warm place to keep the dough. However, it is okay to keep the dough at a lower
temperature than the recommended one, as long as it's reasonable for a human being -- the 
microorganisms will be slower to reproduce, but they will still be there, working and
producing gas.

The duration for the bulk fermentation stage varies, but in general it should take anywhere
from 3 to 24 hours. The bulk fermentation can be considered done when the dough size increases
to around twice the orignal dough size.

Every 2 to 3 hours, perform another around of stretch and fold while you let the dough ferment.

## Pre-shaping, and Secondary Fermentation

When the dough size has increased to the desired level, you will now shape the dough.
This step is called "pre"-shaping because the dough is further shaped during the time
it is rested afterwards, as well as the "coupe"ing (i.e. cutting the dough) at the next
stage.

Prepare your basket, and place a piece of cloth on it. Dust the cloth using
rice flour. Rice flour is not mandatory, but it is recommended
that you use flour that absorbs less water than wheat flour (such as rye flour).

Prepare a smooth surface to work on. You will need a space of around 80cm by 60cm.
Lightly dust the surface with rice flour. 
Do NOT dust the surface heavily, as you will need the dough to stick to the surface a bit.

Take the dough out of the bowl and place it gently over the dusted surface.
Use a dough scraper to easily move the dough out of the bowl.

Dust your fingers lightly, and stretch the dough to a roughly rectangular shape, keeping the
same dusted side down, touching the surface.

Place the rectangular shaped dough on the surface, and fold the right and left sides onto
the center of the dough. Then stich the dough at the center, by pulling the dough from each side
towards the center, pinching them togher to form a bond. This step is performed to stitch the
dough together, but it also serves as to create tension in the outer surface of the dough.

Once the center is stiched, you should have a long, stick like dough. Starting from the end
that is close your body, roll the dough towards the other end, creating a "roll".

Using your dough scraper, push the dough from one side to the other. The dough should be
sticking just slightly to your working surface, resisting to move. While the dough resists and
you keep pushing, you will notice that the dough folds over itself at the bottom, where it is
sticking to the working suface. This pulls the surface of the dough, and creates tension,
which is what we want.

Repeat the above process from other sides, and this should create a round dough with tension
at the surface. When you have a round dough, use your dough scraper to lift the dough, and place
your dough gently onto the basket, upside down (the seem that used to be at the bottom of your
dough should now be facing upwards).

Place a piece of moist cloth over it, and let it rest for an hour. If you can, you might
want to rest the dough in the refrigerator.

## Shaping, and Baking

After the dough has rested, take your dutch oven, and place it in the oven without the top lid.
Preheat the oven up to 290 degrees celcius.

When the oven is ready, take the dough out from the basket, and place it over a perchment that
is large enough for your bread. To take the dough out, simply place the perchment over the
dough while it's still in the basket, and simply flip it upside down.

Place the dough and the perchment onto a surface. Take your razor, and cut the dough at its
surface, straight through the center. This incision is called the "coupe", and there are various
ornamental decorations you could do with it, but in  this sample we're just using the simplest form.
The incision does not need to be too deep, but it could go for 5mm to 1cm. This coupe acts a release
for the vapors that will form within the dough. This way the vapors know exactly where to escape from.
Without it, they will try to escape from whereever they can, thereby creating holou es and cracks in your dough
at random locations.

Take the dutch oven out of the oven carefully, and place the dough and the perchment inside it.
Put the lid on the dutch oven, and put the dutch oven back into the oven. It is important to
keep the lid, as we would like the vapors that come out of the dough to be available during
the initial baking phase. By providing moisture, the bread crust does not harden too quickly,
thereby allowing the dough to expand and rise.

Bake for 20 minutes at 290 degrees celcius. After the time has passed, remove the lid, and
lower the temperature to 230 degrees celcius. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the crust is
brown to your liking.

Once the baking is done, remove the bread from the oven, and let it cool completely.
DO NOT attempt to cut it while it is hot, as there are still hot vapors in the bread,
which you want to retain inside the bread.

After it has been cooled, you can slice it and enjoy it. Toast the slices if you would like.
Try to consume the bread within approximately 3 days. Also, try to cover the sides that you
cut/sliced using plastic wrap while preserving, to avoid the moisture from escaping.

...and enjoy your sourdough!
